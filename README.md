# hyperion_preproc_gee_code
These are example codes for preprocessing EO-1 Hyperion images from Digital Numbers to Surface Reflectance in the Google Earth Engine cloud-computing platform.
Included are Google Earth Engine codes for
-converting digital numbers to radiance
-aligning VNIR and SWIR images
-destriping
-smile correction draft (this is not ready to use, but is a start)
-spectral subsetting
-atmospheric correction using the SMARTS model
-cloud and cloud shadow masking included in the atmospheric correction script.

In addition, a spectral smoothing script for R is included.
