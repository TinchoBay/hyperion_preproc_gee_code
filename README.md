# hyperion_preproc_gee_code
These are example codes for preprocessing EO-1 Hyperion images from Digital Numbers to Surface Reflectance in the Google Earth Engine cloud-computing platform.
Included are Google Earth Engine codes for 1) converting digital numbers to radiance, 2) aligning VNIR and SWIR images, 3) destriping, 4) smile correction draft (this is not ready to use, but is a start), 5) spectral subsetting, 6) atmospheric correction using the SMARTS model, 7) cloud and cloud shadow masking included in the atmospheric correction script.  In addition, a spectral smoothing script for R is included.
